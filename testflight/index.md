# TestFlight / Alpha Testing Addendum

**Last updated:** November 18, 2025

This Addendum applies when you install a **TestFlight** or other pre-release version of PicSeal (“**Pre-Release Software**”).  
It supplements the **PicSeal Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy**.

By using a TestFlight build, you agree to this Addendum.

## 1. Experimental nature

Pre-Release Software may:
- Be incomplete or unstable  
- Contain bugs or performance issues  
- Change significantly before public release  
- Be removed at any time  

Do not rely on Pre-Release Software for preserving or storing important photos.

---

## 2. Additional data collection during testing

In addition to the data described in the Privacy Policy, TestFlight builds may collect:
- Additional error logs  
- Additional performance or failure data  
- Diagnostic information needed to evaluate scanning and enhancement features  

We do **not** collect screen recordings or session replays.

---

## 3. Scanner training data (optional)

If you enable **Help improve PicSeal**, scanner photos you capture in TestFlight builds may be uploaded to help us:
- Diagnose scanning issues  
- Test variations of detection or cropping algorithms  
- Evaluate new feature concepts  
- Improve training datasets and model accuracy  

Turning the toggle off stops new uploads but does not remove photos already used for development or model improvement.

---

## 4. Data resets

During testing, we may:
- Reset accounts  
- Clear test data  
- Change backend structures  
- Modify or delete information stored by the test environment  

Always keep personal copies of important photos outside PicSeal.

If you submit feedback, you grant us a license to use that feedback to improve the Service.
