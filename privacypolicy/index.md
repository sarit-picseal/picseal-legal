This Privacy Policy explains how **PicSeal**, operated by **Quokka LLC**, collects, uses, and shares information when you use our iOS application PicSeal (the “**App**”) and our legal website at `legal.picsealapp.com` (together, the “**Service**”).

If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the Service.

## 2. Information we collect

We collect information needed to operate and improve PicSeal, including:

### 2.1 Information you provide
- **Email address** when you sign in using Sign in with Apple  
- **Messages and attachments** you send when you contact us for support  

We do not collect passwords.

### 2.2 Photos and media you submit

PicSeal processes photos in two ways:

#### a) Scanning (photos captured using the in-app scanner)

If you choose to **help improve PicSeal**, the App may upload photos captured using the in-app scanner for research and product-improvement purposes.

Scanner photos may:
- Be used to train and evaluate our photo-detection and cropping models  
- Help us understand the types of items users want to preserve and improve overall scanning accuracy  

Photos you **import from your photo library** are **not** used for training.

Scanner training is **optional** and can be turned on or off at any time.

#### b) Enhancements and effects (photos you submit for processing)

When you request an enhancement, the App temporarily uploads the photo so we can generate the result and return it to you.

Enhancement photos:
- Are used only to perform the service you request  
- Are retained for a short period (up to **7 days**) for processing and troubleshooting  
- Are **not** used to train our models  

### 2.3 Usage and analytics data

We collect limited, privacy-focused analytics to understand usage patterns and improve the Service, such as:
- Which features are used  
- Whether scanning or enhancement succeeded or failed  
- Basic device information (e.g., device model, iOS version)  
- General location (e.g., country), if provided by the OS  

We do **not** collect:
- Screen recordings  
- Session replays  
- Raw photo content through analytics  
- Bounding boxes or face-level metadata for analytics

### 2.4 Device and diagnostic data
We may receive anonymized crash reports and performance diagnostics to help us fix issues and improve stability.

### 2.5 Information from Apple
If you make a purchase, Apple provides us with anonymized transaction information needed to manage your subscription.  
We do **not** receive your payment card details.

## 5. Retention

- **Scanner training photos (opt-in)**  
  - Retained only as long as needed for training and evaluation.  
  - Once incorporated into training datasets or models, they cannot be individually removed because they are no longer linked to specific users.

  - Retained for up to **7 days** for processing and troubleshooting, then deleted.

- **Account & communications**  
  - Retained while your account is active or as required for legitimate business or legal reasons.

- **Analytics**  
  - May be retained in aggregated or de-identified form.

---

## 6. Your choices

### 6.1 Scanner training (opt-in)
You can enable or disable scanner training any time in Settings.

Turning it off stops new uploads but does not remove photos already incorporated into training datasets or models.

### 6.2 Access, correction, deletion
Depending on your region, you may request:
- Access to personal information  
- Correction of inaccurate information  
- Deletion of certain information  

We may be unable to delete:
- Photos already incorporated into de-identified training datasets  
- Machine-learning models derived from training data  
- Information we are legally required to retain
