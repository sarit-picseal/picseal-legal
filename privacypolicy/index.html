  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: November 18, 2025</small></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>PicSeal</strong>, operated by <strong>Quokka LLC</strong>, collects, uses, and shares information when you use our iOS application PicSeal (the “App”) and our legal website at <code>legal.picsealapp.com</code> (together, the “Service”).</p>

  <p>If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the Service.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Who we are &amp; how to contact us</h2>

  <p><strong>Quokka LLC</strong><br>
  202 N Cedar Ave Ste 1<br>
  Owatonna, MN 55060<br>
  USA</p>

  <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:contact@picsealapp.com">contact@picsealapp.com</a></p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

  <p>We collect information needed to operate and improve PicSeal, including:</p>

  <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> when you sign in using Sign in with Apple.</li>
    <li><strong>Messages and attachments</strong> you send when you contact us for support.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect passwords.</p>

  <h3>2.2 Photos and media you submit</h3>

  <p>PicSeal processes photos in two ways: scanning and enhancements.</p>

  <h3>a) Scanning (photos captured using the in-app scanner)</h3>
  <p>If you choose to <strong>help improve PicSeal</strong>, the App may upload photos captured using the in-app scanner for research and product-improvement purposes.</p>
  <p>Scanner photos may be used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Train and evaluate our photo-detection and cropping models.</li>
    <li>Help us understand the types of items users want to preserve and improve overall scanning accuracy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Photos you <strong>import from your photo library</strong> are not used for training.</p>
  <p>Scanner training is <strong>optional</strong> and can be turned on or off at any time.</p>

  <h3>b) Enhancements and effects (photos you submit for processing)</h3>
  <p>When you request an enhancement, the App temporarily uploads the photo so we can generate the result and return it to you.</p>
  <p>Enhancement photos:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are used only to perform the service you request.</li>
    <li>Are retained for a short period (up to <strong>7 days</strong>) for processing and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>Are <strong>not</strong> used to train our models.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Usage and analytics data</h3>
  <p>We collect limited, privacy-focused analytics to understand usage patterns and improve the Service, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which features are used.</li>
    <li>Whether scanning or enhancement succeeded or failed.</li>
    <li>Basic device information (e.g., device model, iOS version).</li>
    <li>General location (e.g., country), if provided by the OS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Screen recordings.</li>
    <li>Session replays.</li>
    <li>Raw photo content through analytics.</li>
    <li>Bounding boxes or face-level metadata for analytics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 Device and diagnostic data</h3>
  <p>We may receive anonymized crash reports and performance diagnostics to help us fix issues and improve stability.</p>

  <h3>2.5 Information from Apple</h3>
  <p>If you make a purchase, Apple provides us with anonymized transaction information needed to manage your subscription. We do not receive your payment card details.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>

  <p>We use your information to:</p>

  <h3>a) Provide and operate PicSeal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform scans, enhancements, and features.</li>
    <li>Authenticate your account.</li>
    <li>Deliver results to your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b) Improve PicSeal</h3>
  <p>Scanner photos (only if you opt in) may be used to improve detection accuracy and the quality of our scanning algorithms.</p>

  <h3>c) Develop new features</h3>
  <p>We use anonymized usage insights and, where applicable, opt-in scanner photos to research and evaluate improvements to the App.</p>

  <h3>d) Communicate with you</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Respond to support inquiries.</li>
    <li>Send important updates about the Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>e) Safety &amp; compliance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect prohibited content or misuse.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
    <li>Enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Sharing your information</h2>

  <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

  <p>We may share information with:</p>

  <h3>4.1 Service providers</h3>
  <p>Trusted providers who help us operate the Service, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage and hosting providers.</li>
    <li>Analytics providers.</li>
    <li>Machine-learning infrastructure providers.</li>
    <li>Customer support and operational tools.</li>

  <h3>4.2 Business transfers</h3>
  <p>If Quokka LLC or PicSeal is sold, merged, or reorganized, your information— including scanner training datasets and derived models—may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Legal or safety reasons</h3>
  <p>We may disclose information to comply with the law or protect rights, safety, and property.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. Retention</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scanner training photos (opt-in)</strong><br>
      Retained only as long as needed for training and evaluation. Once incorporated into training datasets or models, they cannot be individually removed because they are no longer linked to specific users.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Enhancement photos</strong><br>
      Retained for up to <strong>7 days</strong> for processing and troubleshooting, then deleted.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Account &amp; communications</strong><br>
      Retained while your account is active or as required for legitimate business or legal reasons.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong><br>
      May be retained in aggregated or de-identified form.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Your choices</h2>

  <h3>6.1 Scanner training (opt-in)</h3>
  <p>You can enable or disable scanner training any time in Settings.</p>
  <p>Turning it off stops new uploads but does not remove photos already incorporated into training datasets or models.</p>

  <h3>6.2 Access, correction, deletion</h3>
  <p>Depending on your region, you may request:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to personal information.</li>
    <li>Correction of inaccurate information.</li>
    <li>Deletion of certain information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may be unable to delete:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos already incorporated into de-identified training datasets.</li>
    <li>Machine-learning models derived from training data.</li>
    <li>Information we are legally required to retain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To make a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@picsealapp.com">contact@picsealapp.com</a>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than where you live. We use appropriate safeguards where required.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>PicSeal is not directed to individuals under 18. Photos you scan may depict minors; by using PicSeal, you represent that you have the right to scan them.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and administrative safeguards to protect your information. No method of data transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>
