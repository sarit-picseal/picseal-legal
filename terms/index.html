  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: November 18, 2025</small></p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the PicSeal iOS application and related services (the “Service”), operated by <strong>Quokka LLC</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).</p>

  <p>By installing or using PicSeal, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Who may use PicSeal</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction) or use PicSeal only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms on your behalf.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to scan and upload the photos you process with the App.</p>

  <h2>2. License and acceptable use</h2>
  <p>We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use PicSeal on Apple devices you own or control.</p>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineer or decompile the App.</li>
    <li>Attempt to access or modify the Service in unauthorized ways.</li>
    <li>Upload or process illegal or harmful content.</li>
    <li>Infringe others’ rights, including privacy and intellectual property.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Your photos and content</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of all photos and content you submit (“Content”). To operate the Service, you grant us the following limited licenses:</p>

  <h3>3.1 Operation license (applies to all users)</h3>
  <p>You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Host, process, modify, and transmit Content as needed to:
      <ul>
        <li>Perform scans.</li>
        <li>Apply enhancements.</li>
        <li>Provide support.</li>
        <li>Deliver results back to you.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This license ends when we delete the relevant Content under our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Training license (optional; only applies if you opt in)</h3>
  <p>If you enable the setting to <strong>Help improve PicSeal</strong>, you grant us an additional license to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect and process photos captured using the in-app scanner.</li>
    <li>Use these photos for research and product improvement, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Training, testing, and evaluating algorithms.</li>
        <li>Understanding scanning use cases and improving detection accuracy.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This license:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is worldwide, irrevocable, sublicensable, and royalty-free.</li>
    <li>Continues for photos already incorporated into datasets or model improvements.</li>
    <li>Does not apply to photos you only import from your library.</li>
    <li>Does not apply to enhancement photos.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Turning off the toggle stops new uploads but does not remove photos already used in datasets or models.</p>
  <p>We will not use your scanner photos to create unrelated, general-purpose public models.</p>

  <h2>4. Pre-release and TestFlight versions</h2>
  <p>If you install a pre-release or TestFlight version of PicSeal, additional terms apply. You agree to the <strong>TestFlight / Alpha Testing Addendum</strong> at:</p>
  <p><a href="https://legal.picsealapp.com/testflight/">https://legal.picsealapp.com/testflight/</a></p>
  <p>Pre-release versions may contain bugs, performance issues, or incomplete features. Do not rely on pre-release versions to store or preserve important photos.</p>

  <h2>5. Purchases and subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Some features require a paid subscription or in-app purchase.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments are processed by Apple.</li>
    <li>All refunds are handled by Apple according to their policies.</li>
    <li>We do not have access to your full billing information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Subscription details may change prospectively, but changes will not affect your current billing period.</p>

  <h2>6. PicSeal is not a backup service</h2>
  <p>PicSeal temporarily processes your photos to provide scans and enhancements. It is not intended to be your only storage location.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for keeping your own copies of important photos (for example, in your device’s Photos library or your preferred backup provider).</p>

  <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>PicSeal, including its design, features, and underlying technologies, is owned by or licensed to Quokka LLC.</p>
  <p>These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, branding, or proprietary technologies.</p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind.</p>
  <p>We do not guarantee:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>That PicSeal will work without errors or interruptions.</li>
    <li>That scans or enhancements will meet your expectations.</li>
    <li>That all defects will be corrected quickly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You use PicSeal at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.</li>
    <li>Our total liability will not exceed the greater of:
      <ul>
        <li>The amount you paid in the 12 months prior to the claim, or</li>
        <li>USD $50.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations.</p>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Quokka LLC and its employees from any claims arising out of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your use of PicSeal.</li>
    <li>Your Content.</li>
    <li>Your violation of these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms occasionally. We will update the “Last updated” date and notify you if changes are significant.</p>
  <p>If you do not agree, you must stop using PicSeal.</p>

  <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.</p>
  <p>Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Minnesota, USA.</p>
