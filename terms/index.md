# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** November 18, 2025

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your use of the PicSeal iOS application and related services (the “**Service**”), operated by **Quokka LLC** (“**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”).

By installing or using PicSeal, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

## 1. Who may use PicSeal

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction) or use PicSeal only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms on your behalf.

You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to scan and upload the photos you process with the App.

---

## 2. License and acceptable use

We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use PicSeal on Apple devices you own or control.

You agree not to:
- Reverse engineer or decompile the App  
- Attempt to access or modify the Service in unauthorized ways  
- Upload or process illegal or harmful content  
- Infringe others’ rights, including privacy and intellectual property  

We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms.

## 3. Your photos and content

You retain ownership of all photos and content you submit (“**Content**”).  
To operate the Service, you grant us the following limited licenses:

### 3.1 Operation license (applies to all users)

You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to:
- Host, process, modify, and transmit Content as needed to  
  - Perform scans  
  - Apply enhancements  
  - Provide support  
  - Deliver results back to you  

This license ends when we delete the relevant Content under our Privacy Policy.

### 3.2 Training license (optional; only applies if you opt in)

If you enable the setting to **Help improve PicSeal**, you grant us an additional license to:

- Collect and process photos captured using the in-app scanner  
- Use these photos for research and product improvement, including  
  - Training, testing, and evaluating algorithms  
  - Understanding scanning use cases and improving detection accuracy  

This license:
- Is worldwide, irrevocable, sublicensable, and royalty-free  
- Continues for photos already incorporated into datasets or model improvements  
- Does **not** apply to photos you only import from your library  
- Does **not** apply to enhancement photos  

Turning off the toggle stops **new** uploads but does not remove photos already used in datasets or models.

We will not use your scanner photos to create unrelated, general-purpose public models.

## 4. Pre-release and TestFlight versions

If you install a pre-release or TestFlight version of PicSeal, additional terms apply.  
You agree to the **TestFlight / Alpha Testing Addendum** at:
